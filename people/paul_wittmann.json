    "description": "Although Paul fell in love with programming at an early age, he set out on the quest to untangle the ultimate code - NL (natural language) - in the forms of literature and philosophy. He's highly versed in deconstructing anything from Shakespeare to Heidegger. Nevertheless, Paul always maintained a strong interest in web technology and mathematics. We're excited he has now decided to make Rails his fulltime project and to head our Ruby poetry department.",
