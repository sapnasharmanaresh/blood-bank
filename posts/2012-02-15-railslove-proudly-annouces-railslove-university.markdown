Last year Railslove did some workshops for companies like <a href="http://adcloud.com/">AdCloud</a> and <a href="http://dailydeal.de/">Daily Deal</a>, where we taught them some basics about Ruby and Rails and some more advanced tips & tricks about api design. Then some US guys called 2012 to be the year to learn to code and we've started thinking if we should do this more often: training people, who are interested in learning to code.

Some of us still remember the early days at university, when <a href="http://railslove.com/lars_brillert">Lars</a>, <a href="http://railslove.com/jan_kus">Jan</a>, <a href="http://railslove.com/tim">Tim</a> and <a href="http://railslove.com/stephan_pavlovic">Stephan</a> got into Ruby and Rails in a 3-day hands-on workshop led by our <a href="http://galaxycats.com/">friends and Rails masters from outta space</a>. So the first thing that came to our mind was to give others the same chance we've once had and so we anounced a beginner's workshop "Ruby and Rails from Scratch" for students of Cologne University of Applied Sciences to take place in early January at our offices. As we've talked to some other developers and friends about it, we quickly found out that there are even more people other than students interested in our intensive Rails training, so we made it official and silently launched our <a href="http://university.railslove.com">Railslove University</a>.

On the 4th of January we started with 9 participants and a day full of Ruby. <a href="http://twitter.com/ralph">Ralph</a> not only taught them about the beauty of code, but also introduced them to basic priciples of coding in general, of course testing your code was a big part of it. The next two days were all about Rails. We started with a short introduction to the framework itself and peppered it with extensive hands-on parts to start building an own little web application. After covering all essential parts of a web app with Ruby and Rails we finished the workshop with a big round of pizza for everybody and a ceremonial presentation of our gorgeous diplomas.

As a motivation to go further and because we like a little competition all workshop participants were invited to a coding challenge, endowed with a 50 € amazon.de voucher. All in all we had a great time and so did our trainees. Here's what <a href="https://twitter.com/timmes">Tim Czubayko</a> said about it:

<blockquote>One workshop. Three speakers. And a lot of interesting hands-on parts. The "Ruby on Rails from Scratch" workshop showed that test-driven development is a lot more fun than I've expected. With this workshop I'm up with all the advanced basics of Rub on Rails programming.</blockquote>

Now, if you're gonna say: "How I could I miss this?!", we're glad to announce a few more workshops in the near future: There'll be <a href="http://university.railslove.com/courses/3">a next Rails beginner workshop in march (Mar 14 - Mar 16)</a>. If you're interested in it, sign up now! Or wait, there's even more: By popular demand we also host some advanced workshops to cover special topics in-depth like <a href="http://university.railslove.com/courses/5">building APIs that last</a>, <a href="http://university.railslove.com/courses/4">Going Global -- Internationalization (i18n) of Rails web applications</a> or <a href="http://university.railslove.com/courses/2">BYOMAC - Bring Your Own Models And Controllers</a>. We hope you like them and we'd be super-glad to welcome you at one of our next workshops, too.

Well, we've got one more thing: We'll have some superhero-class guest teachers on board working on their curricula. Be sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/rl_university">@rl_university</a> on Twitter to keep at it.

Remember: If you can't get good Ruby on Rails nerds? Let your coders join one of our courses!
