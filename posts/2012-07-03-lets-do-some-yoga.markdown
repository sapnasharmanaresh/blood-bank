Railslove is starting yoga exercises after hours. Every programmer needs some silence after a day full of hardcore programming action. So we thought yoga is the best way to relax. Yoga not only evokes positive changes like a better posture and balance but also ensures more agility. Decrease your weight in a healthy way and reduce your stress factor. Our instructor is <a href="http://trinistudio.com/index.php/uberuns">Paulina Izworska</a>.

If you want to participate in the course just let us know <a href="http://www.doodle.com/3fxe79nii7s5vfve">via doodle</a> if you're coming. The costs are round about 10 Euros per Person for a 1-1.5 hour training.
