Yesterday it was announced on [deutsche-startups.de](http://www.deutsche-startups.de/2013/12/11/high-tech-gruenderfonds-makerist/), that our client [makerist](http://makerist.de) has received funding from [High-Tech Gr√ºnderfonds](http://www.high-tech-gruenderfonds.de/) and another anonymous investor.

makerist is a new website for DIY enthusiasts selling professionally produced [video tutorials](https://makerist.de/courses), e.g. in the areas of sewing, knitting, crochet and more to come. Users can also buy the necessary materials for those video courses in the [makerist DaWanda shop](http://de.dawanda.com/shop/makerist) and share the results of their [DIY projects](https://makerist.de/works) with the makerist community.

We are very pleased with the development of makerist since the launch in September (see our [pre launch blog post](http://railslove.com/blog/2013/09/03/makerist-launch)). Thanks to the investment, more and more [video courses](http://makerist.de/courses) are being produced and we are constantly adding new features.

**Responsive design**

For example, we are currently in the process of making more and more of the pages completely reponsive to offer a great experience on any kind of device be it a laptop, tablet or smartphone. As a foundation for the responsive HTML & CSS we use, aptly named, Zurb's [Foundation framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) which has worked very well for us so far. The responsive features that Foundation offers include for example, a [responsive grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html), carefully crafted [media queries + utiltity CSS classes](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/visibility.html), and a solution for [responsive images](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/interchange.html). We encourage you to check it out. With good tools like that and a proper design, the sometime daunting task of making a page responsive can actually be just a little bit of extra effort. And we really think that it pays off.

**Payment with Skrill**

Another notable feature in makerist is the integration of [Skrill](https://www.skrill.com/) as the payment service provider (besides PayPal). makerist was the very first customer to be able to use their new payment service offering, which provides a JavaScript component (skrill.js) that allowed us to build a checkout workflow that is completely customized and optimized for makerist's needs. No redirects or ugly iframes that provide a suboptimal user experience and ultimately hurt conversion. We were able to leverage some great synergies here, since Skrill is also a client of us and we are heavily involved in building their new modern payment service offering.

**makerist gift coupons**

Finally, we recently added the possiblity to buy [makerist gift coupons](https://www.makerist.de/gift-coupons) - an ideal Christmas present for all your loved ones that are into sewing, knitting, or crochet. If you want to get an idea of the kind of courses that makerist offers, you can find a [list of all there courses](https://www.makerist.de/courses), or try out one of their two free courses:

We are looking forward to the road ahead with makerist with some great new features in the pipeline and hopefully more growth into new user segments and other topic areas.  It definitely is a big pleasure for us to work on this project, especially since we are all very fond of the whole "DIY idea" ourselves - we are currently simply better with bits and pixels than with needle and thread.
