<a href="http://blog.railslove.com/2012/04/27/heart-charmer/">Following the craze</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLP:FiM#Internet_following">bronies</a> loving our Easter Egg, I've decided to take my time today and release this code as a jQuery plugin.

Behold, <a href="https://github.com/Holek/Pinkify/">Pinkify</a>! It's in an early stage, but when you have a look at <a href="https://github.com/Holek/Pinkify/blob/master/jQuery.pinkify.js#L24">available options</a>, you'll get the idea what you can do.

A more detailed documentation is yet to come.
