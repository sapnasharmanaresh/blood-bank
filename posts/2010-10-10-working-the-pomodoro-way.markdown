The last two weeks I have been practising the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/index.html">Pomodoro Technique</a>.

The Pomodoro Technique was created by <a href="http://www.francescocirillo.com/fc.html">Francesco Cirillo</a> 18 years ago.

The basic idea is to:
<ul>
	<li>Choose a task to work on.</li>
	<li>Set the Pomodoro to 25minutes.</li>
	<li>Work on you task.</li>
	<li>When the timer rings, take a short break (I take 5 minute breaks)</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
Every 4 rounds take a longer break (I take 15 minutes).

There is a great <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/36672142/The-Pomodoro-Technique">e-book</a> for you enjoyment.

While working the Pomodoro Technique I have found that I am able to get into "the zone" a lot quicker.

My advice:
<ul>
	<li>Be as strict as possible with the structure.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have a task before you start. Dont just float into a cycle.</li>
	<li>If you're on OSX, I recommend this <a href="http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/">app</a>. It is also open source!</li>
	<li>Have a drink and a snack, like dried fruits, next to you. If you become thirsty or slightly peckish, it won't interfere with your current cycle</li>
</ul>
If you have any tips, post them below.

<strong>Edit:</strong>

In the comments Paule asked for suggestions of things to do in the 5 minute breaks.

The idea of the break is to allow you to disconnect from your work. The book mentions that this "allows the mind assimilate what's been learned in the last 25 minutes".

So in layman terms, thats anything that doesn't make you think too hard.

A few things that I do:
<ul>
	<li>Eat. Something that doesn't require too much preparation, like a piece of fruit or a chocolate bar (but not too many ;) )</li>
	<li>Read email. I do <strong>not</strong> answer my emails. If they require a reply, I star them.</li>
	<li>Read <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</li>
	<li>Read <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>.</li>
	<li>Talk to other <a href="http://railslove.com/about-us">Railslovers</a>.</li>
	<li>Get a quick drink.</li>
	<li>Read a quick blog post.</li>
	<li>Prepare/start the washing machine</li>
	<li>etc...</li>
</ul>

If you find yourself thinking "fuck! Quick! What should I do?". It may be worth writing a list of things that you can do and pick one.
