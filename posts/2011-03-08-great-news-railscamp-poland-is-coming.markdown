After the awesome Railscamps in UK or Germany we have great news for all Rails-Hackers! The very first Polish Railscamp will take place very soon, on the weekend of 8-10 April 2011. It’s gonna take place in the beautiful Polish town of Wisła (this very venue to be precise). The camp will be cheap, open for geeks from Europe and it’s gonna be a lot of fun!

What is Railscamp all about? Coding, talking, playing Guitar Hero (PlayStation, voleyball – you get the point), sharing, socializing, going for a nice walk in the mountains. So pretty much whatever everyone feels like!

Sounds interesting? The registration date as well as more details will be announced this Friday. The number of attendees is unfortunately limited so make sure you follow the Friday’s instructions. See you in Wisła and stay tuned.
