In the end of November (30.11 & 01.12) Railslove will team up with cologne's [Startplatz](http://www.startplatz.de/) to bring technical knowledge to productmanagers, project leaders and founders, who are confronted with technological material, discussions and decisions on a daily basis but have not worked on a professional level in this field yet.

The registration for this 2-day workshop is already open and right now a few early bird tickets are left, so hurry up and grab one [here](http://www.startplatz.de/event/startplatz-tech-mba-by-railslove/).

[Paul](http://railslove.com/team/paul_wittmann/) and [I](http://railslove.com/team/stephan_pavlovic) will try to work with the participants on different topics in the field of web development and improve their ability to work on a professional level with technical people.

On the first day we will concentrate on the web application itself; we will go through the different levels of a backend and end up looking at different solutions for mobile applications and the possibilities of todays clientsite application frameworks like (ember)[http://emberjs.com/] or (Angular)[http://angularjs.org/].

The second day will be focused on topics around the actual application, we will look at alternative database systems and discuss advantages and disadvantages. Later on we will look at some external services, that help you to automate certain tasks around the operation of an application like hosting, deployment or testing.

Hope to see you there!

Ps: For everybody who wants to go even more technical, there are rumors we will do another 3 day "Rails for Beginners" workshop in January 2014, so stay tuned.
