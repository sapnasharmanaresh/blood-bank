First of all - a big, big thank you to <a href="http://twitter.com/adcloud">@adcloud</a> for hosting last DevHouseFriday. The location is perfect for such events - nice conference room, a terrace, free beer and some food. Thanks again!

The last DevHouseFriday had cool talks too: <a href="http://twitter.com/tisba">@tisba</a> talked about loadtesting in the cloud <a href="http://twitter.com/killerg">@killerg</a> was talking about his PDF-Dragon idea, we had a interesting talk about <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://javac.info/">Closures for Java</a> (by TJ) so, thanks again.

Unfortunately someone has stolen an <a href="http://twitter.com/adcloud">@adcloud</a> chair from the office. Turns out it was one of the Railslove guys. At the event only handful of Railslovers were present: <a href="http://railslove.com/items/georg_leciejewski">Georg</a>, <a href="http://railslove.com/items/jan_kus">Jan</a>, <a href="http://railslove.com/items/lars_brillert">Lars</a>, <a href="http://railslove.com/items/michael_bumann">Michael</a> and <a href="http://railslove.com/items/dirk_jost">Dirk</a>.... Apparently, it was Jan. He got his punishment for this. Now this Chair is his burden to bear, and he has to take it on every other DevHouseFriday Chillout meetup.

So, see you next time, the next DevHouse Friday Chillout is on the October, 21th. Venue will be announced soon. Jan the Chairman will also be there to throw rocks at.
