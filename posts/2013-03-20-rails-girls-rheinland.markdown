On March 1st and 2nd the first Rails Girls Rheinland Workshop took place in Monheim - organized by [Tatjana](https://railslove.com/team/tatjana_lajendacker/), me and some awesome guys and girls from [innoQ](https://www.innoq.com) - the company that kindly offered to host the event. (Here's what it's all about: [Rails Girls Rheinland - Build your ideas](http://railslove.com/blog/2012/12/12/rails-girls-rheinland-build-your-ideas))

We were happy to welcome 30 women from the age of 15 to 30+ ;). Ten coaches stepped forward to lend a hand including our own [Jan](https://railslove.com/team/jan_kus/) and as a very special coach [Verena Würbel](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/verena-würbel/6/362/59b), who came in touch with Rails Girls as a attendee at [Rails Girls Cologne](http://www.railsgirls.com/cologne). 
So after a few  months of organizing, this package of pandas arrived in between Dusseldorf and Cologne and I knew we were in for a fun weekend. And so it was: Huge fun, very inspiring, motivating and helpful. Great ladies - great atmosphere - Wow!

[Tim Ottowitz](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=198974927&locale=de_DE&trk=tyah) did a nice video of the weekend. Take a look:

And here's some pictures Christian took during the event: [Rails Girls Rheinland Workshop on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/darkhawk/sets/72157632939303346/)

134 bottles of Mate, 8 huge family Pizzas, lots of lovely quiche and salad and soup, 30 apps, 5 lightning talks, 1 hangout with the Rails Girls Baltimore and a reasonable number of lovely cocktails later it was all over. 

And you know what? Now that a few days have passed by and we all had the chance to look back and it's all sunk I can say: There will be another one. Rails Girls Cologne and Rheinland will be back! (Well, we're there: Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsCologne) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/railsgirls_cgn) and come visit our monthly meetups)

I really hope the ladies got the spirit, were inspired and become active members of the awesome ruby community around. Don't forget that the first days are always challenging ones. Try to tackle this challenge with a sense of mischief, fun and devilment, and a raft of like-minded people. 

So Ladies: GET EXCITED AND MAKE THINGS! <3 <3 <3
