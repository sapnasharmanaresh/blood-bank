Join our Railslove Housewarming Challenge

"Hit the buzzer, and join a team." – At tonight's Housewarming party you'll either be green or purple, because we'll have two teams competing for the virtual* Railslove Housewarming Trophy!

Yeah, we like games – and if you do, too, here's how you help your team win:

- Stephan has placed an unkown number of heart stickers all across our offices. Go find them, take pictures and send them to green@railslove.com or purple@railslove.com to make them count for your team. The team which finds more hearts wins.
- Tatjana likes you to collect items in your team's color, that you have brought with you. Wearing green socks today? Perfect! You're carrying a purple bag? Great! The team which collects more items in their color wins.
- Tim hopes you have your twitter with you. Tweet about our party and tag it with #railslove AND #teamgreen resp. #teampurple. The more tweets with your tag, the more wins for your team!
- Jan invites you to compete at our foosball table. Whenever you play a green/green vs. purple/purple match this evening, note down the winning party at the wall next to the table. The overall winning team gets the +1 for this challenge!
- Jakob has been busy all week to measure the floor area of our office (or he was clever to enough to look it up in our contract). Anyway, how much square meters do you think it is? Write it down on a paper of your team's color, fold it, put it in the box. Based on all guesses, he'll calculate your team's average guess. The team closer to the exact measurement wins.

Five challenges, 6pm – 11pm. Go Green, Go Purple! Have fun!

(Please contact our referees mentioned in the text for any assistance throughout the challenges. By joining a team you accept that our referees are always right in their decisions. Always!)

* Well, yeah. We don't really have a trophy for the winning team. So, this is all more about the fun of it and the feeling of happiness. And isn't happiness even a greater gift?
