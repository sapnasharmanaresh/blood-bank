Shortly: a few days ago, someone spotted that the word ["Hackathon"](https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/3020120063403/DE?lang=en) is registered as a trademark in germany. We decided to try to remove this registration as a trademark. 

Why? Because I'm a hacker. Because as I said a few days ago: 

_I've organized #hackathons, I'm organizing a #hackathon and I will continue organizing #hackathons & I will continue calling them #hackathons!_.

Nuff said.

Stay tuned.
