We're very proud to present our latest client work - [makerist](http://makerist.de). makerist is the winner of the [Interactive Cologne](http://interactive-cologne.com) startup pitches and we're proud to have the chance to work with [Axel Heinz](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/axel-heinz/8/954/38) (CEO of makerist) again. We worked with him in the early days of [9flats](http://www.9flats.com) and it was productive and fun!

The name makerist is a _portmanteau_ of _maker_ and _artist_ and describes pretty well what this project is all about. It's a community for people who love handmade stuff and offers video tutorials on different techniques in the fields of knitting and sewing. Other categories will follow in the future. People can communicate with professional teachers, showcase their latest work and discuss techniques and tricks with like-minded people.
