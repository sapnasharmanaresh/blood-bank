We're very proud to present our latest client work - [makerist](http://makerist.de). Makeirst is the winner of the [Interactive Cologne](http://interactive-cologne.com) startup Pitches and we're proud to had the chance to work with [Axel Heinz](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/axel-heinz/8/954/38) (CEO of Makerist) again. We've been working  with him in the early days of [9flats](http://www.9flats.com) and it was productive and fun!

The name makerist is a connection of maker and artist and describes pretty good, what this project is all about. It's a community for people, who love handmade stuff and offers video lectures about different technics in the field of knitting and sewing. Other categories will follow in the future. People can communicate with professional teachers, show their latest work and discuss technics and tricks with like-minded people.
