One of our latest project was the registration app for the [Eurovision Song Contest 2013](http://www.eurovision.tv/). Together with [Grandcentrix](http://grandcentrix.net) we've build an [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/eurovision-song-contest-official/id625994547) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.digame.esc) app. It's basically a second screen app with a voting option.

A few tech-spechs behind our app will be published soon. For now - just go ahead and download the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/eurovision-song-contest-official/id625994547) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.digame.esc) app and have fun next week during the Semi-finals on May 14th and 16th and the Grande final on May 18th!

Until then - have fun watching the promo video:
