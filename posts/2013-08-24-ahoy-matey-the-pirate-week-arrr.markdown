As every year in August Cologne will turn into a pirate's hideout. On August 26th and 27th the European Pirate Summit (http://piratesummit.com) takes place in Cologne. The Pirate Summit is an event for all the crazy startups, investors, professionals and developer among us. And as every year the pirate fun will happen at Odonien - the best place for more than 700 pirates. 
 
In addition to the regular event, there are a large number of other side events during the whole Pirate Week. As the years before, Railslove is proud to being involved into that event. We're helping out with a few satelites events from Friday until Wednesday. Here is an overview of the week... 
 
The whole Pirate Week starts on Friday (23.08.) at 09:00 a.m. with the likemind meeting. At this meeting you can find likeminded people with backgrounds in Web, Tech or Media who come together to talk, share ideas or just drink coffee. 
 
On the same evening we continue with the DevHouseFriday Chillout (http://devhousefriday.org). This event ist intended for the hackers among us. It takes place every second month in different locations. This time we meet  at Content Management AG in Mediapark 6A. The agenda looks very promising . Start is at 6 p.m. - open end.  You can still submit talks, just write a short message to jan@railslove.com. The event covers a wide range of subjects hard- or software, project management, web... there's something in it for everyone. Afterwards we can visit the Bierfestival at Mediapark. Participation is free of charge.
 
On Saturday and Sunday (24.08. - 25.08.) the PirateHack (http://piratehack.org) will take place for the first time in our harbor! ARRRR! This is a hackathon for real pirates. Under the slogan "A ship in harbor is safe - but that is not what ships are built for. Hack the harbor - release all the ships!" we will hack for two days in at coworking space Bottmühle/Railslove GmbH (http://railslove.com). The focus will be on the"Kickerhack" project, it all started at Interactive Cologne where we tried to count all te goals automatically by unsing Anykey (http://anykey0x.de). Aim is to transmit all results to the Kickerapp (http://kicker.railslove.com) and to add a opensource kicker lamp soon. Have a look at http://therealkicker.com how does it work! This is going to be a real pirate fun! 
 
Monday and Tuesday (26.08. - 27.08.) it gets really going! ARRR! The Pirate Summit (http://piratesummit.com) opens its doors at 1 p.m. For two days startups, investors and coder from all over the world will meet to discuss hot stuff and crazy new shit. Top speaker like Jörg Binnenbruecker, Carlo Matic, Sitar Teli, Frank Thelen, Tim Schumacher, Milo Yiannopolous, Evan Nisselson and much more are expected. Our "The Real Kicker" football table will be also there - with all those extras we've hacked during the Pirate Hack.
