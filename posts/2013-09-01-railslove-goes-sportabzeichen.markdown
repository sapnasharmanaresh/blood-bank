Since the beginning of the year Railslove is working for the [DOSB](http://www.dosb.de/). As a first project we builded a tool for the german [Sportabzeichen](http://sportabzeichen.splink.de) where users can check the requirements for gold, silver and bronze; track there performances and find places to train.

Following the "eat your own dog food" principle the splink team and some of us here at railslove decided to grab their old track and field clothes and discover how long 3000 meters can be.

So on a sunny thursday afternoon at perceived 40 degrees [Liane](http://www.railslove.com/liane_thonnes), [Isabell](http://www.railslove.com/isabell_slowik), [Tatjana](http://www.railslove.com/tatjana_lajendacker), [Jakob](http://www.railslove.com/jakob_hilden), [Marco](http://www.railslove.com/marco_schaden), [Marco](http://www.railslove.com/marco_schaden) and me got on a train to Weidenpesch, where we met our coach for the day, Manni.

After a extended warmup we started with the first discipline of the day, 100m.

The quickest railslover of them all with lighning fast 13.1 seconds was [Marco](http://www.railslove.com/marco_schaden).

A quick stop at the oxygen tent and we were ready for some strength disciplines with shot put and standing long jump. Much credit here went to [Liane](http://www.railslove.com/liane_thonnes), who celebrated here bronze jump directly in the sand.

Halfway through the disciplines we continues with some coordination. The girls concentrate on skipping while the boys tried high and long jump. I had to recognize, that I'm not 18 anymore and 1.65m equal 1.45m if you nearly reached the 30's.

After this went on to the great finale, 3000m (in words: three thousand meters) running. Special props go to our top smoker [Isabell](http://www.railslove.com/isabell_slowik), who battled herself to silver.

The next days at the office you could easily identify the participants, because all of us where hoppling and complaining about the pain in every single bone.

One week later we went to Agrippabad for the final discipline, because for the Sportabzeichen you need a prove of your schwimming capabilities. We combined the 25m sprint with some fun at the waterslide.

Besides all of the suffering, everyone was sure, that we will do it again next year. Maybe this time we will do some training in advanced to battle for the overall gold category.
