Since the beginning of the year Railslove is working for the [DOSB](http://www.dosb.de/). As a first project we built a tool for the german [Sportabzeichen](http://sportabzeichen.splink.de) where users can check the requirements for gold, silver and bronze; track their performances and find places to practice.

Following the "eat your own dog food" principle the splink team and some of us here at railslove decided to grab their old track and field clothes and discover how long 3000 meters can be.

So on a sunny thursday afternoon with apparent air temperature of 40 degrees [Liane](http://www.railslove.com/liane_thonnes), [Isabell](http://www.railslove.com/isabell_slowik), [Tatjana](http://www.railslove.com/tatjana_lajendacker), [Jakob](http://www.railslove.com/jakob_hilden), [Marco](http://www.railslove.com/marco_schaden) and me got on a train to Weidenpesch, where we met our coach for the day, Manni.

After an extended warmup we started with the first discipline of the day, 100m.

The quickest railslover of them all with lightning fast 13.1 seconds was [Marco](http://www.railslove.com/marco_schaden).

A quick stop at the oxygen tent and we were ready for some strength disciplines with shot put and standing long jump. Much credit here went to [Liane](http://www.railslove.com/liane_thonnes), who celebrated her bronze jump directly in the sand.

Halfway through the disciplines we continued with some coordination. The girls concentrated on skipping while the boys tried high and long jump. I had to recognize, that I'm not 18 anymore and 1.65m equals 1.45m if you nearly reached the 30's.

After this we went on to the great final, 3000m (in words: three thousand meters) running. Special props go to our top smoker [Isabell](http://www.railslove.com/isabell_slowik), who battled herself to silver.

The next days at the office you could easily identify the participants, because all of us where limping and complaining about the pain in every single bone.

One week later we went to Agrippabad for the final discipline, because for the Sportabzeichen you need a proof of your swimming capabilities. We combined the 25m sprint with some fun at the waterslide.

Besides all of the suffering, everyone was sure, that we will do it again next year. Maybe this time we will do some training in advance to battle for the overall gold category.
